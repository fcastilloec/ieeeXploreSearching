SUMMARY: This guide provides general recommendations for the selection of methods, equipment, and tools that have been found to be practical for the stringing of overhead transmission line conductors and overhead groundwires. The guide also includes a comprehensive list of definitions for equipment and tools used in stringing and for stringing terms commonly employed. This guide does not address special conductors such as those used for river and canyon crossing. These conductors may be custom designed and often may require special considerations.",
